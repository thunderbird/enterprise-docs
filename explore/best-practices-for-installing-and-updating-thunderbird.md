# Best practices for installing and updating Thunderbird

## Automatic updates <a id="w_configuration-options"></a>

By default, automatic updates are enabled in Firefox. We recommend you keep this feature so your users can have the latest security patches and features.  
  
You can ensure that automatic updates are installed without user interference by using the [AppAutoUpdate](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#appautoupdate) policy.

If you need to turn off automatic updates, you can do this using the [DisableAppUpdate](https://github.com/thundernest/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#disableappupdate) policy.

For more information on policies, see [Managing Thunderbird policies](../manage-updates-policies-and-customization/managing-thunderbird-policies/).

## Beta Builds <a id="w_beta-builds"></a>

Beta builds of Thunderbird allow you to test features before they are released to the regular version of Thunderbird. They are a good way to identify issues with upcoming features and updates before they are released to the rest of your organization.

To download beta builds or daily test builds of Thunderbird, see [The future of Thunderbird \(Beta channel / Nightly channel\)](https://www.thunderbird.net/#channel).
